Using steps.py in this repository for a starter file, write a Python program to calculate average number of steps per month for a year.

The input file (which you will read from the command line, see the sample program on how to read command line arguments in this repository) contains the number of steps (integer) a person took each day for 1 year, starting January 1. Each line of input contains a single number.

Assume this is NOT a leap year.

Your output must follow this format:

The average steps taken in MONTH NAME was 9999.9
Where 9999.9 represents that month's average. Be sure to output only a single decimal digit (digit to the right of the decimal)

Be sure to spell out the name of the month. First letter must be caps. For example: June

For a grade of A your program should handle a leap year by looking at the number of steps in the file, if 365 then non leap year, if 366 then leap year.

Submit your source code to CodePost.io

All programs you submit should have the following comments at the start of your source code file.
